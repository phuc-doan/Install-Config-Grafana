# Install-Config-Grafana

### What is Grafana ❓❓

**Grafana is an opensource dashboard/dashboard that supports a wide variety of dashboards and graphs for easy monitoring** 

- **As a platform for building `analytics` and `monitoring`** 📵❗

- After getting the metric from the system, Grafana will analyze and create a dashboard describing the **metrics** for monitoring such as **`CPU, Ram, Disk, ...`**

Besides Grafana, **Prometheus** is also a free OpenSource that Administrators often use :vv. I will present it in a separate section later :vvv

## **`Okay, Let's get started`** 🟢🟢
